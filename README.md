- dialer-like input control extension for QlikView


QvDial is a modern, touch-enabled way to set a numerical value to any variable defined in a QlikView Document.
This extension is not another chart type, but a control element. It instead is kind of a replacement/addition to the regular slider control. 

Visit http://blog.dijit.de/qvdial-qlikview-extension/ â€Ž for more details and demo stuff.

Usage
=====

- Drag the *QvDial*-Extension on your QlikView document
- don't wonder about missing caption and frame - they are de-activated by default
- right-click the control and open the properties
- set the correct variable name (default is vInput1)
- close the properties dialog and click somewhere on the ring
- the variable will be re-set to the selected value
